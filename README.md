# DummyJSON

DummyJSON can be used with any type of front end project that needs products, carts, users, todos or any dummy data in JSON format.

## Architecture
The two-tier is based on Client Server architecture. The two-tier architecture is like client server application. The direct communication takes place between client and server. There is no intermediate between client and server. Because of tight coupling a 2 tiered application will run faster.
